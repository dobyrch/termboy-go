Term Boy
========

Term Boy is a Nintendo Game Boy emulator...for your terminal.

This is an early implementation written in Go. A more complete version (written
in C++) is available [here](http://github.com/dobyrch/termboy).

This project is based on code from an existing Game Boy Color emulator,
[gomeboycolor](http://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor).

Usage
-----

After running `go install`, start Term Boy by running the provided script (i.e.
`./termboy <ROM.gb>`) in a Linux virtual console. Use ESDF for the D-pad, G/H
for SELECT/START, and J/K for B/A.  Press ESC to quit.
